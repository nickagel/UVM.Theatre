You wonÃ­t be able to catch your breath as the mild mannered protagonist navigates his way through a maze of murder and espionage entanglements and death defying spectacles. The 39 Steps is a love letter to the magic of theatre!",

Through the lens of theatre, and both its transformative and destructive powers, this gripping story unfolds. Both poignant and heartfelt Marat/Sade is experimental, entertaining and totally immersive theatre.",

Tickets go FAST, so purchase early! The seasonal favorite follows the adventures of Sunny, a cheerful, inquisitive rag doll brought to life by the Toymaker, whose toyshop is filled with living toys. The selfish Toymaker refuses to sell or give the toys away, preferring to keep his creations to himself. Then Sunny makes an astonishing discovery that divides the loyalties of her newfound friends and jeopardizes the Toymaker's claim to be the \"Greatest Toymaker in the World!\" A Toy drive to benefit Toys For Kids of VT will be happening at the Royall Tyler Theatre during performances on Saturday December 5th and Sunday, December 6th. Please bring a new unwrapped toy to the box office in the lobby at the Royall Tyler. A red barrel will be in the lobby provided by the Marine Corps League.
